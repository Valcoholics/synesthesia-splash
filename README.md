### kismetcasa

The homepage for Kismet Casa -- [view the site](https://kismetcasa.xyz)

What the site does right now:

- SPA(single-page application) that shows:
  - main logo
  - description
  - events
  - NFTs
  - contact info
  - form to apply to a Kismet Casa event(s)

Longer term edits:

- Move internal content packages to DAOKit so packages and content can be edited in one place(no-code as well, espc. important for the content)
- Add some crazy design down the line(eg. maybe a 3D representation of the Buenos Aires hacker house, where each room is a different section of the website?)
