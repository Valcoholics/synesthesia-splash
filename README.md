The homepage for Kismet Casa -- [view the site](https://kismetcasa.xyz)

What the site does right now:

- SPA(single-page application) that shows:
  - main logo
  - description
  - events
  - NFTs
  - contact info
  - (maybe) some sort of form?
    - once that form is finished, it can be easily embedded/linked to on the site

Short-term tasks to tackle:

- Tidy-up current styling to get to a solid 0.1, which might include but isn't limited to:
  - new font?
  - mess with the padding
  - add some super basic loading animations with `framer-motion`
  - add more to the description sections
  - [on my end, @dylsteck] make some performance improvements to `<ZoraNFTViewer />`

Longer term edits:

- Move internal content packages to DAOKit so packages and content can be edited in one place(no-code as well, espc. important for the content)
- Add some crazy design down the line(eg. maybe a 3D representation of the Buenos Aires hacker house, where each room is a different section of the website?)
