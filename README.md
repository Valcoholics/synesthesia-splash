To run the app locally:
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- (optional) Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your Google Analytics ID
- Start the app: `npm run dev`

What the site does right now:
- SPA(single-page application) that shows:
  - main logo
  - description
  - events
  - NFTs
  - contact info

Longer term edits:
- Add a form to apply to a Kismet Casa event(s)
  - note: [this is working on wip/form](https://github.com/dylsteck/kismetcasa/tree/wip/form), we just need to choose form contents and then deploy
- Move internal content packages to DAOKit so packages and content can be edited in one place(no-code as well, espc. important for the content)
- Add some crazy design down the line(eg. maybe a 3D representation of the Buenos Aires hacker house, where each room is a different section of the website?)
